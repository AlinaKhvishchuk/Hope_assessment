# LocalLink Project

I worked on a mobile app project called Local Link, which aimed to connect people living in the same area or buildings without the need for sharing personal information like email or phone numbers. My contributions to the project were significant. I initially came up with the idea for Local Link and played a pivotal role in planning the initial features.

I also implemented a calendar feature that allowed users to view upcoming events and add their own events. This calendar used the react-native-calendar library and provided users with the ability to select dates, retrieve events for specific dates, and add new events.

Additionally, I worked on implementing Drawer Navigation, enabling users to upload images to Firebase, and created various forms, such as Lost and Found and adding items to a Marketplace. These forms were created with the Formik library, which works well with TypeScript and the Yup package. We also utilized the expo-image-picker and Firebase storage for image uploads.

The project included real-time chat functionality and a Marketplace for buying and selling goods. The Lost and Found and Recommendations sections had a similar setup but served different purposes. Lastly, I contributed to the "report issue" feature for users to provide feedback or report problems.
