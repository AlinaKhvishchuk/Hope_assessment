# React.js Assessment - HOPE

## Introduction

This React.js assessment is divided into two sections, each designed to evaluate my understanding of React.js concepts and my practical coding skills.

## Section 1: Theoretical Knowledge

In this section, I answered theoretical questions to demonstrate your understanding of basic and advanced React.js concepts. You can find the answers to these questions in the document provided here: [Section1_answers](Section1_answers.txt)

## Section 2: Coding Implementation

The second part of this assessment assesses my ability to apply my knowledge to practical projects. The link on a project GitHub repository is here: [WriteWise](https://github.com/AlinaKhvishchuk/WriteWise).
